# SpringFlingDemo

This project highlights some exciting new features in Xamarin alongside some of the powerful existing functionality. 

### Xamarin.Forms
Write once. Run everywhere. Be native.

### Xamarin.Forms Previewer
*Currently in alpha.* View your app's UI on Android and iOS (including custom renderers and design time data) while writing a XAML based UI.

### Xamarin.UITest
Automate your UI testing using C#. Tests can be generated with the Xamarin Test Recorder, fine tuned with many interactions and assertions available to UITest and NUnit, and launched locally or in Test Cloud. Increase your test coverage by testing your app on thousands of devices in Xamarin's Test Cloud.
